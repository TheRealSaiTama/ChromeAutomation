Web Auto
========

This is a Python script that uses the `webbrowser` module to open a list of websites using Google Chrome.

Usage
-----

1. Save the script as `webauto.py`
2. Run the script using `python webauto.py`

The script will open the following websites using Google Chrome:

* `gmail.com`
* `google.com`
* `youtube.com`
* `github.com`

Each website will be opened in a new tab.

Dependencies
------------

* `webbrowser` module (installed by default in Python)
* Google Chrome browser (not included in the script, must be installed separately)

Note
----

This script uses the `webbrowser` module to open the websites, which uses the default web browser installed on the system. In this case, we're assuming that Google Chrome is installed and set as the default browser. If Chrome is not installed or not set as the default browser, the script may not work as expected.
